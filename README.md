Finally the boards and documentation are ready. It's been a while since the BeBoPr+ ran out of stock. But now, at the time this page was created, several BeBoPr++ boards have already sold and shipped around the world. It's no longer one of these vapour-ware products. Public announcements on pricing and how to order will follow soon.

**First of all, [here's the manual](https://github.com/modmaker/BeBoPr-plus-plus/blob/master/BeBoPr%2B%2B User Manual.pdf), finally available for public download.**

More information and the software tree can be found at the original [BeBoPr repository](https://github.com/modmaker/BeBoPr) and [wiki pages](https://github.com/modmaker/BeBoPr/wiki), but that information is not always up-to-date for the BeBoPr++. It does contain pointers, history and information that lead to the realisation of the BeBoPr++.
