Finally the boards and documentation are ready. It's been a while since the BeBoPr+ ran out of stock. But now, at the time this page was created, several BeBoPr++ boards have been sold and shipped around the world. It's no longer a vapour-ware product. Public announcements on pricing and how to order will follow soon.

**First of all, [here's the manual](https://github.com/modmaker/BeBoPr-plus-plus/blob/master/BeBoPr++ User Manual.pdf), finally available for public download.**

The cape's **product page** can be found [**on the elinux.org wiki**](http://elinux.org/BeBoPr++).

More information and the software tree can be found at the original [**BeBoPr repository**](https://github.com/modmaker/BeBoPr) and [**wiki pages**](https://github.com/modmaker/BeBoPr/wiki), but that information is not always up-to-date for the BeBoPr++. It does contain pointers, history and information that lead to the realisation of the BeBoPr++.
