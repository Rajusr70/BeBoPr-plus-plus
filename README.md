## Documentation
A summary of the features can be found on the cape's **[product page](http://elinux.org/BeBoPr++)** on the [Embedded Linux Wiki](http://elinux.org/Main_Page). For more details see the [**complete manual**](https://github.com/modmaker/BeBoPr-plus-plus/blob/master/BeBoPr++ User Manual.pdf), that's available as pdf. More online information can be found [**via this link,**](https://github.com/modmaker/BeBoPr/wiki/The-BeBoPr-plus-plus-Cape) on the original BeBoPr wiki and at the [**BeBoPr forum**](http://forum.bebopr.info)

Even more information, including [**the software tree**](https://github.com/modmaker/BeBoPr), can be found via the designer's [**github home page**](https://github.com/modmaker) and the [**BeBoPr wiki pages**](https://github.com/modmaker/BeBoPr/wiki). Beware that the Wiki also has information is no longer applicable for the BeBoPr++. It does contain pointers, the history and other information that lead to the realisation of the BeBoPr++ though.
